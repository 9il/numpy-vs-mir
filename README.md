# Python vs. D using multigrid

## Abstract
TODO (ist das Kunst oder kann das weg?)

## Motivation
Python is a well known and often used programming language. Its C-based packages like numpy allow an efficient computation.
But there is another programming language comming up the last years **D**

D combines the best parts of C and Python and is therefore competitive to pythons numpy package. It serves an numpy like D-package called MIR.
This makes D comparabel to Python. Therefore, we decided to implement a multigrid implementation in both languages and compare their FLOPs.


## Methods
### Python multigrid
### D multigrid
### Meassurements

## Results

Benchmark W-cyclce, 2 pre-, postsmooth
Problemsize: 200, 400, 600 ... 4000
